1. Membuat record mrp.bom.line terpisah terlebih dahulu
2. Menggunakan field 'bom_line_ids' atau kolom dengan format khusus di spreadsheet import
   yang akan otomatis membuat record mrp.bom.line berdasarkan produk
3. Format bom_line_ids: (0, 0, {'product_id': id, 'product_qty': qty})
4. Saat melakukan import via CSV/XLS, product_id bisa berupa nama produk
   dan Odoo akan mencari produk dengan nama tersebut

### Special Import Rules:
#### order_lines_import:
Saat mengimpor Sales Order, baris pesanan dapat didefinisikan dengan dua cara:
1. Membuat record sale.order.line terpisah terlebih dahulu
2. Menggunakan field 'order_line' atau kolom dengan format khusus di spreadsheet import
   yang akan otomatis membuat record sale.order.line
3. Format order_line: (0, 0, {'product_id': id, 'product_uom_qty': qty, 'price_unit': price})
4. Saat melakukan import via CSV/XLS, product_id bisa berupa nama produk
   dan Odoo akan mencari produk dengan nama tersebut
